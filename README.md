# Unofficial Dropout YouTube Browser
Browsing Dropout shows on YouTube can be a hassle because of how YouTube's search works. This is a web application that organizes the shows and episodes in a way that makes it easy to browse and keep track of what you've watched.

## Features
- Search for shows by name
- Favourite shows to easily find them later
- Filter episodes by category
- Mark episodes as watched

## Limitations
Everything is stored on your browser, so your data doesn't sync automatically across devices. Additionally, linked YouTube videos open in a new tab and always start from the beginning due to YouTubeâ€™s playback behavior, even if you've already watched part of the episode.

Because of YouTube's API quota limits, the show and episode data is updated every hour. This does happen automatically, but you will have to wait at most an hour to see the latest changes.
